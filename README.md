# Minimal Neural Network Decision Boundary Visualization

A PyTorch implementation to demonstrate how a minimal neural network can learn decision boundaries for custom-generated datasets, and to visualize the initialized and final decision boundaries.

## Overview

This project aims to:

- **Generate custom datasets** with specified cluster parameters.
- **Define and train a minimal neural network** with PyTorch.
- **Visualize the initialized decision boundaries** before training.
- **Visualize the final decision boundary** after training.
- **Extract and print the equations** of the decision boundary lines in the original feature space.

## Features

- Customizable data generation with clusters of specified centers, standard deviations, number of samples, and labels.
- Minimal neural network architecture suitable for learning linear decision boundaries.
- Visualization of both initial and trained decision boundaries.
- Extraction of the equations of the decision boundaries in the original feature space.

## Installation

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch

### Install dependencies

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn torch
```

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Customization

You can customize the dataset by modifying the `cluster_params` variable in the `main()` function. Three examples are provided:

- **General Lines** (currently active)
- **Horizontal Lines** (commented out)
- **Vertical Lines** (commented out)

## Example Output

*Include example plots generated by the script (decision boundaries before and after training).*
