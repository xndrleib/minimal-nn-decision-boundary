# Minimal Neural Network Decision Boundary Visualization

A PyTorch implementation designed to demonstrate how a minimal neural network can learn decision boundaries for custom-generated datasets that can be separated using piecewise linear boundaries.

## Overview

This project aims to:

- **Generate custom datasets** with specified cluster parameters.
- **Define and train a minimal neural network** with PyTorch, specifically tailored for datasets separable by piecewise linear boundaries.
- **Visualize the initialized decision boundaries** before training.
- **Visualize the final decision boundary** after training.
- **Extract and print the equations** of the decision boundary lines in the original feature space.

## Features

- Customizable data generation with clusters of specified centers, standard deviations, number of samples, and labels.
- Minimal neural network architecture suitable for learning linear decision boundaries.
- Visualization of both initial and trained decision boundaries.
- Extraction of the equations of the decision boundaries in the original feature space.

## Important Notes

1. **Data Requirement**: The algorithm is designed **only for data that can be separated with piecewise linear boundaries**. It assumes that the classes can be separated using straight lines in 2D space.

2. **Manual Definition of Lines**: The **number of linear boundaries (lines) required to separate the classes should be defined manually**. This number determines the minimal number of neurons in the hidden layer.

3. **Optimal Performance**: Optimal performance **cannot be guaranteed**. The results highly depend on the **initialization of the weights** in the neural network. Careful initialization is crucial for the network to learn the correct decision boundaries.

## Approach Description

### Minimal Neural Network Architecture

- **Input Layer**:
  - **Neurons**: 2 neurons corresponding to the two dimensions of the input space.

- **Hidden Layer**:
  - **Number of Neurons**: Each neuron represents a linear boundary (a line in 2D space). Therefore, the number of neurons in the hidden layer should at least equal the number of linear boundaries required to separate the classes.
  - **Activation Function**: A non-linear activation function like **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit) is used to introduce non-linearity, enabling the modeling of complex decision boundaries.

- **Output Layer**:
  - **Neurons**: 1 neuron with a **sigmoid** activation function (suitable for binary classification) to output the class probabilities.

### Determining the Minimal Number of Hidden Neurons

- **Linear Boundaries Required**: Analyze the data to determine the **minimum number of linear segments** needed to separate the classes.
- **Hidden Neurons**: Each hidden neuron corresponds to one linear boundary. Therefore, the minimal number of hidden neurons equals the minimal number of linear boundaries required.
- **Conclusion for General Solution**: The minimal architecture is a **2-input, *k*-hidden neurons, and 1-output neural network**, where *k* is the minimal number of linear boundaries needed to separate the classes.

## Installation

### Dependencies

- Python 3.11
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn torch
```

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Customization

### Defining the Number of Lines for Separation

- **Manual Setting**: In the `main()` function, set the `hidden_size` variable to the number of linear boundaries you need. This determines the number of neurons in the hidden layer.

  ```python
  hidden_size = k  # Replace k with the number of linear boundaries
  ```

### Customizing the Dataset

You can customize the dataset by modifying the `cluster_params` variable in the `main()` function. Three examples are provided:

- **General Lines** (currently active)
- **Horizontal Lines** (commented out)
- **Vertical Lines** (commented out)

## Example Output
